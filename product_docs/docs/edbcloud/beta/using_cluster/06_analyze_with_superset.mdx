title: "Analyze with Apache Superset"
---
You could use Apache Superset to analyze, explore, and visualize data stored in your PostgreSQL clusters.
If you are logged in to EDB Cloud and have permissions to access superset, you can open Apache Superset using one of **Analyze** links.

!!! Note
    Apache Superset shares Single Sign On with EDB Cloud. If you log out of  Superset you will be logged out of EDB Cloud and vice-versa.


## Connecting Superset to your Cluster

To connect superset to your cluster you need to provide a connection string for your cluster.
As described [here](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/postgres#postgres) the connection string must have the following format:


 `postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}?sslmode=require`

To find the host and port  of your cluster:



1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.
2. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.
3. Select the name of your cluster.
4. Select the **Connect** tab and  find **Host** and **Port** .

Connecting Superset to a EDB Cloud cluster is similar to connecting[ Superset to a new database](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard#connecting-to-a-new-database).
To create a connection to an EDB Cloud cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.
2. Navigate to **Analyze->Connections**.
3. Select **+ Database **button on top right. This will open a dialog box.
4. Enter **DATABASE NAME**.  Enter the connection string for your cluster as **SQLALCHEMY URI**, in the format described above.
5. Check the connection using the **TEST CONNECTION** button and add it if you see success pop-up



Upon successful connection, you are good to add datasets, charts and dashboards.


## Using  Superset Dashboards

You can use Superset Dashboard to analyze data stored in your cluster. [This page](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard) contains instructions for creating a simple Superset dashboard.

To view all available Superset Dashboards, navigate to** Analyze>Dashboards**


## Using Superset Charts

You can use Superset Charts to visualize data stored in your cluster. [Superset documentation ](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data)contains instructions and examples of creating  Superset Chart.

To view all available Superset Charts, navigate to **Analyze>Charts**.


## Using  Superset SQL Lab

You can use Superset SQL Lab to write queries to access/modify data stored in your cluster. To access SQL Lab, navigate to **Analyze>SQL Editor**.


##  Superset Permissions

Access to Superset data sources is controlled by Superset roles. Learn more about Superset Roles, Users and Permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security).

EDB Cloud account using the following special permission:



* _superset:admin_
* _superset:alpha_

These EDB Cloud permissions translate to Superset roles as follows:


| User Superset Role  | EDB Cloud User Role                      | Superset Privileges                                                                    |
| --------------------| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gamma               | Has no any superset related permissions  |  View data they granted access to, can create dashboards          |
| Alpha               |  Include _superset:alpha_ permission     | Gamma privileges +add or alter data sources                       |
| Admin               |  Include _superset:admin_ permission     | Alpha privileges + grant or revoke access to data to other users  |


You can control Access to Superset by using EDB Cloud Roles and special EDB Cloud Superset permissions by assigning superset permissions to the user roles. See [Changing Role Permissions](../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/#changing-role-permissions).
